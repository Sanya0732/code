    <h2 style="text-align: center; background-color: goldenrod;"> German Shepherd  </h2>
    
    <p> The German Shepherd (GSD) is a medium to large dog breed known for their intelligence, loyalty, and protective instincts. They are often used as working dogs in a variety of roles, including police dogs, search and rescue dogs, and service dogs. </p>
    <p> First brought to the United States in the early 20th century, GSDs quickly became popular working dogs. They are also popular family pets, but they require a lot of exercise and training. Of course, this may be worth keeping in mind if youâ€™re thinking of adding a German Shepherd puppy to your home. With time, patience, and a lot of love, these exceptional dogs can make wonderful companions.</p>
