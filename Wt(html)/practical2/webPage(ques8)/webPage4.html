    <h2 style="text-align: center; background-color: goldenrod;"> Siberian Husky </h2>
    <p> The Siberian Husky dog breed has a beautiful, thick coat that comes in a multitude of colors and markings. Their blue or multi-colored eyes and striking facial masks only add to the appeal of this breed, which originated in Siberia. It is easy to see why many are drawn to the Siberianâ€™s wolf-like looks, but beware because this athletic, intelligent dog can act independently and challenge first-time dog parents.</p>
